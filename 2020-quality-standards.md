In line with Hacktoberfest value #2 (Quantity is fun, quality is key), we have provided examples of pull requests that we consider to be low-quality contributions (which we discourage).

Pull requests that are automated (e.g. scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace/fix typos/optimize images).
Pull requests that are disruptive (e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a pull request).
Pull requests that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.
Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your pull request count for October.
Last but not least, one pull request to fix a typo is fine, but 4 pull requests to remove a stray whitespace is not.
