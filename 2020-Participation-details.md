Participation details Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a seasoned contributor or looking for projects to contribute to for the first time, you’re welcome to participate. Pull requests can be made in any participating GitHub-hosted repositories/projects. Maintainers can opt-in to participate by classifying their projects with the hacktoberfest topic. Your pull requests will count toward your participation if they are in a repository with the hacktoberfest topic and once they have been merged, approved by a maintainer or labelled as hacktoberfest-accepted. Additionally, any pull request with the hacktoberfest-accepted label, submitted to any public GitHub repository, with or without the hacktoberfest topic, will be considered valid for Hacktoberfest. You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31. Just be sure to sign up on the official Hacktoberfest website for your pull requests to count.
